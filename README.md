Where I store dotfiles of my programs

## Requirements

- A nerd font (Fantasque Sans Mono's Nerd Font is hardcoded in the files)
- Dmenu
- Bash
- Kitty
- Sway
- Waybar
- Neovim

## Important

- There are some hardcoded `/home/arthur/`, change them.
- `startmywonder` is the script I use to start sway.
